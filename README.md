The XSLT Tree Rendering Library is a set of XSLT programs that I wrote
while working as part of the the Church Project at Boston University.
Some of the code and documentation was also written by Joe Wells.

The library is intended to take transform tree-structured data in an XML
format and pretty-print it as ASCII, XHTML, or LaTeX trees. Included is
a demo that pretty-prints XML documents themselves. The library also
includes useful helper functions that are not part of standard XSLT,
like an implementation of string splitting, text search-and-replace, and
a LaTeXify routine to quote symbols that may have special meaning in
LaTeX.

The XSLT Tree Rendering Library is licensed under the FSF General Public
License. Bug fixes, improvements, and suggestions are welcome.
