As of 2002-05-04, the contents of this directory are files that are
part of a generic package for drawing trees without output in ASCII,
HTML, and LaTeX.

The render-tree-XYZ.xslt files are XSLT stylesheets that will take a
tree (see tree-example.xml for an example of the XML dialect) and
render it in format XYZ.

The render-xml-XYZ.xslt files are XSLT stylesheets that will take any
XML file as input, convert it to the tree format used by the
render-tree-XYZ.xslt file, and then render it in the XYZ format.

(If you want to obtain just the "tree" XML produced as an intermediate
result, you can edit the render-xml-XYZ.xslt file to strip out the
call to the render-tree template in the root level template match.)

The {,last-,no-}child.png file are image files that are used for the
HTML trees to draw the edges in the trees.
